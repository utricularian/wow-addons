--------------------

Infus:
	- Combat log trigger: Remove outdated TODO
	This is now implemented :)
	- Hide a few empty descriptions esepecially in the combat log trigger
	In 0721067c3af2facdbe4079f44569576e40212d1a I added empty descriptions
	after most controls. Those empty descriptions would force the controls
	for the next option to always start at the left column.
	
	That had a unfourtnate effect, since those empty controls take 4px of
	vertical space.
	
	Reduce the impact of that fix by only doing it after multiselect
	controls, which is the control that had the problem in the ticket.
	
	Also add a spacer after the suffix setting of the combat log trigger.
	
	This might lead to some controls being in the wrong column, but
	hopefully won't require readding empty lines everywhere...
	- Fix dynamic group flickering
	If we have two auras with inverse conditions, either of them should be
	visible. Traditionally WeakAuras auto hid auras after they expired.
	
	That can lead to a situation where we hide a aura before we show
	the inverse, which is visible as a small flickering.
	
	Previously I worked around that problem, by slightly delaying the
	auto hiding.
	
	But fundamentally the auto hiding is only needed for auras where their
	removal doesn't result in a event. (E.g. multi buff trigger.)
	
	So remove the auto hiding from buff triggers and remove the delay
	to the auto hiding.
	
	Removing the delay might result in flickering for other cases, but
	those should then properly be fixed by removing the auto hiding
	from them too.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 691
	- Fix "Unstable Affliction" clones

	PLAYER_TOTEM_UPDATE doesn't fire in that case, so add
	PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD to the event list.
