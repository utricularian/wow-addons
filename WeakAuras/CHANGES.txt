    Fix ignore rune cd again
    
    Broke that accidentally with the change for Epidemic.
    
    The intent behind this code is this:
    
    Epidemic is a spell with charges, thus GetSpellCharges is the right api.
    
    We compare durations between the cooldown duration and rune cd duration
    to figure out whether a spell is on cooldown only for a rune.
    
    But Epidemic has the same cooldown duration as runes.
    
    Luckily, GetSpellCharges doesn't adjust it's output based on rune cds.
    
    Thus, we can be sure that any cooldown returned by it cannot be due
    to a rune cd.

    Fix attaching to other auras
    
    Since the order in which the auras are created is somewhat random,
    we must create the anchor frame if it doesn't yet exist.

    Drag'n'Drop implementation for DisplayButtons (#136)
    
    This PR implements drag'n'drop support to the `DisplayButton`s in the Options.
    Feature and Design is descripted in some [sketches](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzaKJginnJcgM3dHWUdDQlNRZGM?usp=sharing).
    
    The implemented features make several `DisplayButton` controls in their current form obsolete.
    Chiefly the side control of grouped buttons (up, down, ungroup) which also distinguish grouped buttons from ungrouped one.
    (see https://www.wowace.com/projects/weakauras-2/issues/790 )
    
    ### Issues
    -  Dropping a element below the list of `DisplayButton` into the scroll frame or onto a category rider undos the drag action. This behavior might be unexpexted.
