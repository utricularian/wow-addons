--------------------

Infus:
	- Change how we assign frame levels to regions
	- Always start at frame level 1
	- Increase frame levels by 4 per region, so that each region
	  can use a few frame levels for its childrens
	- In Aurabar make the child frame levels depend on the parent
	  frame level
	
	In my tests with a group, all combinations of region types are
	now work
	
	Ticket-Nr: 743
	- Fix dynamic groups not attached to their regions
	In commit 2ba0799 I introduced some optimization to make editing huge
	dynamic groups faster, since apparently SetPoint() is a far more
	expansive operation in Legion than before.
	
	That optimization was incorrect, and broke if a aura was e.g. moved
	out of a dynamic group and into it again.
	
	Fix that optimization by checking against what GetPoint() returns

Benjamin Staneck:
	- also fallback to instance chat when using the smart announce function and in a lfd group
Infus:
	- Rune of Power: Fix load condition
	- Small change to circular progress flickering
	While I couldn't reproduce the bug report, and scockah can no longer
	either, since it is apparently related to low frame rates, this
	change should have helped. Instead of using a very fast animation,
	it manually sets the progress to 1.
	
	Ticket-Nr: 632
	- Animations: Don't createa a onFinihsed method for loops
	As each onFinished function would catpure it's predecessorts, this
	would end up keeping a stack of onFinished functions alive and thus
	would slow down the garbarge collector.
	
	Instead, don't create any garbarge.

	- Templastes: Small tweak
	- Fix trigger texts not updating
